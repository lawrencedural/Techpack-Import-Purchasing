# PDF Data Extractor - Accuracy Improvements & Validation Features

## Summary of Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced PDF Text Extraction
- **Improved structure preservation**: Text extraction now uses coordinate-based positioning to maintain table structure
- **Better line grouping**: Items are grouped by Y-position to keep rows together
- **Sorted by X-position**: Text within each line is sorted horizontally to maintain proper ordering

### 2. Improved Parsing Accuracy
- **Multi-line description extraction**: Now looks for descriptions across multiple lines after the item number
- **Enhanced fiber content patterns**: More robust regex patterns to capture various fiber content formats
- **Better unit of measure detection**: Multiple patterns to detect "lb" or "ea"
- **Improved material finish extraction**: Detects "Yarn Dyed", "Piece Dyed", "Garment Dyed"
- **Advanced supplier extraction**: Better context-aware supplier name detection with broader search patterns
- **Improved country detection**: Extended list of countries including Pakistan, Cambodia, Haiti, Guatemala

### 3. New Validation System

#### Validation Checks Performed:
- ✅ Item number presence verification in source text
- ✅ Supplier data completeness (name, country, costs)
- ✅ Field completeness (fiber content, material finish)
- ✅ Description quality (checks for generic fallbacks)
- ✅ Cost and lead time validation

#### Confidence Score:
- Calculates an overall confidence score (0-100%) based on data completeness
- Green: 80%+ confidence (good quality)
- Yellow: 60-79% confidence (moderate quality)
- Red: <60% confidence (needs review)

### 4. New UI Features

#### Data Validation Results Panel:
- **Confidence score**: Overall quality indicator
- **Statistics**: 
  - Total items extracted
  - Items with/without suppliers
  - Items with unassigned fields
- **Issues list**: Shows specific problems found with item numbers and severity levels
- **Warnings list**: Highlights items that may need manual review

#### Raw Text Viewer:
- **View/Download raw extracted text**: See exactly what was extracted from the PDF
- **Debugging tool**: Helps verify extraction quality
- **Downloadable**: Export raw text to text file

#### Validation Recommendations (when confidence < 80%):
- Step-by-step guide on how to validate the parsed data
- Lists common issues to watch for
- Provides actionable recommendations

## How to Validate Data

### Automated Validation (Built-in)
The system now automatically validates:
1. **Completeness**: Checks if all expected fields have values
2. **Quality**: Verifies descriptions are not generic
3. **Accuracy**: Confirms item numbers exist in source document
4. **Supplier data**: Validates costs and countries are present

### Manual Validation Steps

1. **Check Confidence Score**
   - Score ≥80%: Generally reliable
   - Score 60-79%: Review flagged items
   - Score <60%: Manual review recommended

2. **Sample Verification**
   - Pick 10 random item numbers from your PDF
   - Verify they appear in the extracted results
   - Check descriptions match the PDF exactly

3. **Compare Descriptions**
   - Use "View Raw Text" button to see extracted text
   - Compare a few descriptions in the PDF vs extracted data
   - Look for truncation or missing information

4. **Validate Supplier Data**
   - Check supplier names match the PDF
   - Verify countries are correct
   - Confirm cost values are reasonable
   - Check lead times are logical (0-180 days)

5. **Export and Cross-Check**
   - Export to CSV
   - Open in Excel/similar tool
   - Compare against original PDF systematically

6. **Check for Common Issues**
   - Missing descriptions (shows "Item 123456")
   - Wrong unit of measure
   - Items in wrong category
   - Duplicate entries
   - Unassigned fiber content or finish

## Suggested Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Upload PDF
Wait for parsing to complete and note the confidence score.

### Step 2: Review Validation Panel
- Check the confidence score
- Read through the issues/warnings
- Note how many items have problems

### Step 3: Spot Check Items
- Randomly select 5-10 items from the PDF
- Find them in the extracted results
- Verify:
  - Correct item number
  - Accurate description
  - Correct unit of measure
  - Proper category (fabric/trim/packaging)
  - Supplier information present and correct

### Step 4: Validate Supplier Data
- Pick items with supplier information
- Verify supplier names match PDF
- Check country assignments
- Validate costs are reasonable
- Confirm lead times

### Step 5: Export and Final Check
- Export to CSV
- Do a final comparison with the PDF
- Make manual corrections if needed
- Save the validated data

## Tips for Best Results

1. **PDF Quality**: Clear, readable PDFs parse better than scanned documents
2. **Table Structure**: Well-structured tables extract more accurately
3. **Consistent Format**: PDFs with consistent item formats parse best
4. **Review Flags**: Always check items flagged in validation warnings
5. **Spot Check**: Always manually verify 10-15 random items
6. **Use Raw Text**: The raw text viewer helps identify extraction issues

## What to Do When Confidence is Low

1. **Review Raw Text**: Use "View Raw Text" to see extraction quality
2. **Check PDF Quality**: Poorly formatted PDFs cause issues
3. **Manual Correction**: Edit CSV after export for problematic items
4. **Contact Support**: If issues persist, the extraction logic may need adjustment

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Patterns:
- Better regex for item numbers: `^(\d{6})\s+(.+)`
- Enhanced fiber patterns: Multiple percentage-fabric combinations
- Improved supplier patterns: Company name suffixes and locations
- Better unit detection: Multiple patterns for "lb" and "ea"

### Context-Aware Extraction:
- Broader context window for supplier data
- Multi-line description parsing
- Better country detection with extended list
- Improved cost/lead time extraction algorithms

### Performance:
- Deduplication of items
- Efficient text processing
- Fast validation checks
- Optimized rendering

## Next Steps

The system now provides much better accuracy and validation. To get the best results:

1. **Test with your specific PDF format**
2. **Review the validation output carefully**
3. **Use the raw text viewer to debug issues**
4. **Spot check random items for accuracy**
5. **Export and do final validation in Excel**

For specific issues or questions about the extraction, check the issues list in the validation panel for detailed guidance.
