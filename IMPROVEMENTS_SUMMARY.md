# PDF Data Extractor - Complete Overhaul & Accuracy Improvements

## Summary of Major Improvements Made

### 1. **COMPLETELY REDESIGNED PDF Text Extraction Engine**

#### Smart Line Grouping:
- **Y-coordinate clustering**: Groups text items by vertical position (Y-coordinate) with smart rounding to 0.5 precision
- **Eliminates line-breaking issues**: Previous threshold of 0.5 was too strict; new algorithm properly groups items on the same visual line
- **Proper line ordering**: Sorts lines from top to bottom (descending Y-coordinate) to maintain document flow

#### Intelligent Spacing:
- **Context-aware spacing**: Adds spaces between text items based on gap analysis (>5 units)
- **Smart word detection**: Ensures alphanumeric characters are properly separated
- **Preserves column structure**: Maintains tabular layouts in PDFs

#### Empty text filtering:
- **Skips empty strings**: Filters out whitespace-only items that can cause parsing issues
- **Better performance**: Reduces processing overhead from empty elements

### 2. **ENHANCED PARSING ACCURACY** - Complete Rewrite

#### Item Number Detection:
- **Flexible matching**: Now handles whitespace variations with pattern `^\s*(\d{6})[\s:]+`
- **Handles colons and extra spaces**: Works with "123456: Description" or "123456  Description"
- **More reliable**: Catches items that were previously missed due to formatting

#### Multi-Pattern Description Extraction:
- **Three-tier approach**: Tries multiple regex patterns in order of specificity
  1. Extract description stopping at unit of measure (lb, ea, yd, yds, pcs)
  2. Extract description stopping at fiber percentages (e.g., "50%")
  3. Fallback: extract everything after item number
- **Multi-line support**: Automatically continues reading next line if description wraps
- **Smart continuation detection**: Only appends next line if it doesn't look like supplier/fiber data
- **Cleans non-printable characters**: Removes artifacts that can corrupt exports

#### Unit of Measure Detection:
- **Extended support**: Now recognizes lb, ea, yd, yds, pcs, kg, m, meters
- **Normalization**: Converts variations to standard units (yds→yd, pcs→ea, kg→lb)
- **Case-insensitive**: Handles uppercase and lowercase variations

#### Fiber Content Extraction - Completely Rewritten:
- **Expanded material library**: Now includes 17 fiber types:
  - Polyester, Cotton, Nylon, Acrylic, Spandex, Elastane
  - Wool, Silk, Rayon, Viscose, Polycarbonate, Plastic
  - Linen, Modal, Tencel, Lyocell, Bamboo
- **Multi-component parsing**: Captures complex blends (e.g., "50% Cotton, 30% Polyester, 20% Spandex")
- **Recycled material support**: Detects "Recycled Polyester" patterns
- **Two-tier extraction**: First tries complex patterns, falls back to simple ones
- **Handles punctuation variations**: Works with commas, semicolons, and "and" conjunctions

#### Material Finish Detection:
- **Expanded patterns**: Now detects 6 finish types:
  - Yarn Dyed, Piece Dyed, Garment Dyed
  - Dope Dyed, Solution Dyed
  - Raw/Greige
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Works with any capitalization
- **Variations handled**: Recognizes "Dyed", "Dye", etc.

### 3. **ADVANCED SUPPLIER EXTRACTION** - Completely Rebuilt

#### Dynamic Context Window:
- **Smart boundary detection**: Extends context until next item number (up to 25 lines)
- **No more arbitrary limits**: Previous fixed 10-line window often missed supplier data
- **Captures all supplier variations**: Gets suppliers even if they span multiple lines

#### Duplicate Prevention:
- **Supplier deduplication**: Uses Set to track and avoid duplicate supplier entries
- **Maintains data quality**: Prevents same supplier appearing multiple times for one item

#### Enhanced Supplier Name Detection:
- **Known supplier patterns**: Hard-coded detection for common suppliers (Nexgen, Avery Dennison, etc.)
- **Three-tier generic matching**:
  1. Companies with suffixes (Global, Ltd, Inc, Apparel, MSO, Corporation, etc.)
  2. Companies with specific endings (Co., Corp, Company, Filaments, Industries)
  3. General capitalized multi-word names (minimum 2 words)
- **Bullet point handling**: Removes bullets (-, •, *) from supplier names
- **Length validation**: Ensures names are 5-100 characters (filters out headers/junk)
- **Content validation**: Excludes common non-supplier phrases (Size, Color, Width, etc.)

#### Improved Cost Extraction:
- **Broader range**: Now accepts costs from $0.001 to $100 (was $0.001 to $10)
- **Decimal detection**: Only matches numbers with decimal points (filters out integers)
- **Multi-line lookup**: Checks current line AND next line for cost data
- **Smart filtering**: Excludes integers and 6-digit numbers (art numbers)

#### Enhanced Lead Time Extraction:
- **Realistic range**: Accepts 1-120 days (excludes unrealistic values)
- **Length validation**: Only accepts 1-3 digit numbers (filters out art numbers)
- **Dual lead time support**: Captures both "with greige" and "without greige" times
- **Smart positioning**: Takes last two integers as lead times (if 2+ found)

#### Comprehensive Country Detection:
- **30 countries supported**: Extended from 11 to 30 countries
  - Original: China, Vietnam, USA, Hong Kong, El Salvador, India, Canada, Mexico, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia
  - **New additions**: Pakistan, Cambodia, Haiti, Guatemala, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Italy, Portugal, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Myanmar, Malaysia
- **Case-insensitive**: Matches any capitalization
- **Multi-line search**: Checks both current and next line

#### Article Number Extraction:
- **Flexible patterns**: Detects 6-digit numbers, "TBD", "n/a", "N/A"
- **Word boundary detection**: Uses `\b(\d{6})\b` to avoid partial matches
- **Defaults to TBD**: If no art number found, assigns "TBD" for clarity

### 4. **INTELLIGENT ITEM CATEGORIZATION**

#### Section Detection:
- **Improved regex**: Uses `^Fabric(?:\s|$)/i` and `^Trim(?:\s|$)/i` for better accuracy
- **Excludes false positives**: Filters out "Fabric Width", "Fabric Content", etc.

#### Multi-Factor Classification:
- **Primary**: Uses section headers (Fabric/Trim sections)
- **Secondary**: Uses unit of measure (lb/yd → Fabric, ea/pcs → Trim)
- **Tertiary**: Uses description keywords (fabric, textile, cloth → Fabric)
- **Smart fallback**: If unit unclear, analyzes description content

### 5. Existing Validation System (Already Present)

#### Validation Checks Performed:
- ✅ Item number presence verification in source text
- ✅ Supplier data completeness (name, country, costs)
- ✅ Field completeness (fiber content, material finish)
- ✅ Description quality (checks for generic fallbacks)
