  - Costs ($0.001-$100 range)
  - Lead times (1-120 days, validated)
  - Countries (30 countries supported)
- 📊 **Smart Category Organization**: Multi-factor classification into:
  - Fabrics (by section, unit, or keywords)
  - Trims (by section, unit, or keywords)
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Built-in validation with confidence scoring (80%+ typical)
- 🔍 **Raw Text Viewer**: Debug extraction with downloadable raw text
- 💾 **Multiple Export Options**: 
  - Export all data
  - Export by category (Fabrics/Trims)
  - Export to template format
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with Tailwind CSS and validation feedback

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

1. **Upload PDF File**: Simply upload your PDF specification file directly.
2. **Automatic Processing**: The tool will extract text from the PDF and parse all item data.
3. **View Results**: Data is automatically organized into Fabrics, Trims, and Packaging categories.
4. **Export Data**: Click "Export All" or export specific categories to CSV for further processing.

## How It Works

### PDF Text Extraction (Phase 1):
1. **Coordinate-based grouping**: Groups text by Y-coordinate (vertical position)
2. **Smart spacing**: Adds spaces based on gap analysis (>5 units)
3. **Proper ordering**: Sorts top-to-bottom (Y) and left-to-right (X)
4. **Clean output**: Filters empty strings and preserves table structure

### Data Parsing (Phase 2):
1. **Section detection**: Identifies Fabric and Trim sections with improved regex
2. **Item extraction**: Finds all 6-digit item numbers with flexible whitespace handling
3. **Dynamic context**: Extends context window until next item (up to 25 lines)
4. **Description parsing**: Three-tier pattern matching with multi-line support
5. **Supplier extraction**: Three-tier pattern matching, duplicate prevention
6. **Data extraction**: 
   - Fiber content (17 materials, complex blends)
   - Unit of measure (8+ types with normalization)
   - Material finish (6 finish types)
   - Costs, lead times, countries (30 countries)
7. **Classification**: Multi-factor (section + unit + keywords)

### Validation (Phase 3):
1. **Completeness checks**: Verifies all fields have values
2. **Quality checks**: Ensures descriptions aren't generic
3. **Confidence scoring**: Calculates 0-100% score based on data quality
4. **Issue reporting**: Flags items needing manual review

### Export (Phase 4):
- Standard CSV format with all extracted data
- Template format for specific workflows
- Downloadable raw text for debugging

## Testing & Validation

### Quick Test:
1. Upload a PDF specification file
2. Check the **Confidence Score** (should be 80%+ for well-structured PDFs)
3. Review the **Validation Panel** for any warnings
4. Spot check 5-10 random items against the original PDF
5. Export and verify in Excel/CSV viewer

### What to Check:
- ✅ All 6-digit item numbers are extracted
- ✅ Descriptions are complete (not truncated)
- ✅ Fiber content is captured (if present in PDF)
- ✅ Suppliers are listed with correct data
- ✅ Costs and lead times are reasonable
- ✅ Items are in correct categories (Fabrics/Trims)

### Confidence Score Guide:
- **80-100%** (Green): High quality, minimal review needed
- **60-79%** (Yellow): Good quality, review flagged items
- **<60%** (Red): Needs manual review

### Debugging Tools:
- **View Raw Text**: See exactly what was extracted from PDF
- **Validation Warnings**: Lists specific issues found
- **Export CSV**: Compare extracted data with original

### For Best Results:
1. Use clear, well-formatted PDFs (not scanned images)
2. Ensure tables have consistent structure
3. Check validation warnings after each upload
4. Use raw text viewer to debug extraction issues
5. Spot check random items (10-15 recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### Low Confidence Score?
1. View raw text to check extraction quality
2. Ensure PDF is not scanned (text-based PDFs work best)
3. Check if table structure is preserved
4. Review validation warnings for specific issues

### Missing Data?
1. Check if data exists in raw extracted text
2. Verify PDF table structure is consistent
3. Look for unusual formatting or special characters
4. Consider manual correction in exported CSV
