http://localhost:5173
```

If not running, start it with:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Upload a PDF

1. Click the upload area or drag & drop your PDF
2. Wait for automatic extraction and parsing
3. Review the results

### 3. Check Data Quality

Look at the **Confidence Score** in the validation panel:
- **Green (80-100%)**: High quality, minimal review needed
- **Yellow (60-79%)**: Good quality, review flagged items  
- **Red (<60%)**: Needs manual review

### 4. Review Results

Switch between tabs:
- **Fabrics tab**: Shows all fabric items
- **Trims tab**: Shows all trim items

Each row shows:
- Item number (6 digits)
- Complete description
- Unit of measure
- Fiber content
- Material finish
- Suppliers with costs and lead times

### 5. Export Data

Choose your export option:
- **Export All Data**: Complete CSV with all items
- **Export Fabrics/Trims**: Category-specific export
- **Export to Template**: Formatted for specific workflow
- **View Raw Text**: Debug extraction (downloadable)

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After uploading a PDF, verify:

- [ ] Confidence score is 80%+ (Green)
- [ ] All expected item numbers appear in results
